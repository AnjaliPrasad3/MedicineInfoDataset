Atazanavir belongs to a group of medicines known as protease inhibitors (PIs). Atazanavir can slow down how soon you will see symptoms of HIV or slow the damage caused by HIV, but it cannot cure HIV infection. Atazanavir is available as a 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg capsule.\n' +
    'Atazanavir has the ability to block an enzyme in the body called UGT1A1. UGT1A1 is responsible for removing bilirubin from your body. Bilirubin is made in the body when your red blood cells break down through a natural process. If bilirubin is not removed from your body, your skin and eyes can turn yellow. The medical word for this is “jaundice.” A genetic test can be done to determine how well your UGT1A1 works. If your UGT1A1 works slowly, you should avoid atazanavir because you may become jaundiced. Certain people whose UGT1A1 works slowly may have a condition called Gilbert syndrome. For information about UGT1A1 and how it is affected by atazanavir, talk with your doctor or pharmacist, and see “Do you know… UGT1A1 and medicines.” For more details, go to stjude.org/pg4kds.\n' +

If your body breaks down the medicine slower than most people, you should receive lower doses of mercaptopurine. For information about both TPMT and NUDT15 and their effect on mercaptopurine, talk with your doctor or pharmacist, and see “Do you know… Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and medicines.” For more details, go to www.stjude.org/pg4kds.\n' +

It is also used to prevent blood clots from forming after certain surgeries or periods of inactivity or with artificial heart valves.\n' +

    '10-mg white tablet',
    'To help your doctor find the dosage of warfarin you need, a small amount of your blood will be taken. This sample will be tested to find your prothrombin time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR). The PT/INR blood test checks to see how fast your blood clots. Your dose of warfarin will be adjusted to keep your PT/INR in a target range for you.',
    'A large number of factors can affect how your body responds to warfarin, such as changes in diet, physical state (fever or illness), medicines, herbal remedies, and travel. Blood samples will be taken every 3 days when you first start taking warfarin or if you experience any of the factors above.',
    'Once the PT/INR is stable, these blood tests must be done every 2 to 4 weeks. The doctor will use the results to decide if you should stay on the same dose of warfarin or if the dose needs to be changed.',

    'Try not to miss doses of warfarin. If you forget to take a pill, take the missed dose as soon as you can on the same day. Do not double your dose the next day to “catch up.” Call your doctor or nurse for guidelines. Weekly pill boxes are available upon request from pharmacy to help you keep track of doses.',
    'Do not take aspirin, medicines that contain aspirin, ibuprofen or naproxen while you are taking warfarin unless your doctor tells you to do so. These drugs can increase the effect of warfarin and lead to bleeding.',

Do not make any major changes in your daily diet.

Refer to “Do You Know… Anticoagulants and Vitamin K.”',

    'If you need to have surgery or dental work, tell your surgeon or dentist that you are taking warfarin.',
    'Be careful to avoid injury while you are taking warfarin. The risk of heavy bleeding is increased even for routine activities like shaving and brushing or flossing your teeth.',
